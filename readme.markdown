## Why?

You are probably reading this because we recently started working together. While I favour face-to-face communication when building relationships, I've found that a document like this accelerates finding common ground.

The content of this evolving document is a reasonably up-to-date reflection on how to aspire to show up.

## Things I value

As an engineer at heart, I'm passionate about coaching and leading teams to build well-crafted software that delights customers. In my 25 years, I've come to value;

- **_People above all:_** The best software comes from people who have a sense of belonging and purpose and strive to lead balanced lifestyles.
- **_Feedback loops:_** Short, closed feedback loops, implemented in systems, processes and teams, are the life-blood of continuous improvement. Learn from our experiences and adapt to the environment.
- **_Belonging and collaboration:_** Our team is the culmination of each individual, so work hard on working together. Give everyone a voice because our diverse perspectives will help us build great software.
- **_Growth and mentorship:_** Software is about learning! So, invest in our personal development and the growth of others.
- **_Simplicity:_** Maximise value. Focus on one thing. Work in small steps.
- **_Excellence:_** Strive for pragmatism and effectiveness while nurturing our passion and creativity.

## My goal

Above all, I work for the team, and I aim to do this by;

- Providing alignment to vision, strategy, purpose, objectives and other groups,
- Supporting the team by creating an environment where they do their best work,
- Helping explore ideas, identify improvements and eliminate waste, and
- Mentoring, coaching and teaching the team as we grow together.

## Getting hold of me

It's vital that you have support when you need it most. Regardless of how busy my day is, I will drop whatever I can to be there for you.

- **_Slack_** for regular interaction.
- **_Text_** if it is urgent and **_Phone_** if critical.
- I read **_emails_** irregularly.

I prefer talking face-to-face, and my calendar is usually either busy or blocked, **so ping me, and I <u>will</u> find a spot to chat.**

## Some things about me (and quirks)

- Don't be afraid to be painfully candid. I encourage you to open up and share.
- I welcome disagreement as a fantastic opportunity to grow and improve.
- I occasionally get animatedly excited, whether beautiful code, a novel process or small breakthroughs.
- My expression between being stressed, tired, and deep thinking look the same. Don't be afraid to ask :-P
- I swear often. Let me know if it bugs you, and I will make an effort to manage it.
- When people ask questions, I occasionally pause for a seemingly long time to think about it.
- I think and reflect deeply and constantly.
- I work at odd hours. Please do not feel obliged to respond to me when you get messages from me.
- When on a video call, I often fiddle with something to help me from not getting distracted by things like Slack.

## Disclaimer

This document applies to how I work with my immediate colleagues. It doesn't necessarily apply to other leaders in our organisation.

If you see something in here that you like, I suggest you bring it up with your manager and explore how values, principles or practices can work in your setting.

## References

This document was initially inspired by [manager readme's](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe), especially "[How to Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/)." I evolved it to become a general readme to help bootstrap any working relationship.
