With “Moving quality left” the objective is to avoid defects from even getting into the software in the first place.

We should favour defect prevention over defect detection.

Ask yourself the following questions in your next retro:

- What can we do to avoid having bugs?
- How do we ensure that we are building the right thing before we start?
- How do we void anything from being rejected?

TDD has very little to do with testing and everything about specification. It is all about writing the software to the specification that it will be tested under. It is actually still possible doing this manually (If you are not yet comfortable with automated tools)

Have fun…
