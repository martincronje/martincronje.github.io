No real specific questions, and ill take anytime even if it is late in june.

Mainly from a "sole trader" perspective I like having a pipeline of work that i work at. Im not a risk-it-all kind of guy, and i dont want to just throw my CV into the market either. Id rather be a bit more particular with the "who" and "what" so that my energy and commitment are over 100%. Obviously im a realist and beggars cant be choosers - but there needs to be balance. Your more network aware than me, as youve been doing it way longer, when it comes to this kinda thing. You could help me out perhaps with the "who" element, ie who's doing some cool stuff, who's in need of technically strong leadership, who are just nice guys to work with etc.

The other bit of info is around what works for you in the "personal brand" space. How much time do you spend presenting, bloggin etc vs billable work. Im more of an engine room guy, i get more work by doing work, But ill need to extend the other less limelight aspect of my self.

Those are some of the things running around my head, apart from the ever changing web and mobile landscape!

If any of the above you dont want to answer, or feel is in conflict with something or another, please feel free to say so.
