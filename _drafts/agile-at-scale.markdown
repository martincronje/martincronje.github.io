title: Agile at scale
---

I recently received an email where someone asked me to provide some insights on themes and challenges about running "Agile" methodologies at scale. More specifically that there is a lot written about why "Agile" adoptions fail, but very little about "Agile" adoptions at scale.

In a way I think this is the wrong question to ask.

##### What is "Agile"?

Less people  
Less external service providers  
Smaller systems  
Smaller increments  
More automation  
Less projects  
Less divisions  
Less process steps  
Less work in flight
