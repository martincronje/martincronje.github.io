title: "...and we are live"

I decided to start maintaining a blog again after years of silence. My first attempt was in 2008 and it died because I tried too hard to write long well-substantiated overly intellectual posts. It became to much effort given my availability.

This time the goal is simple. Share my experiences warts-and-all in bite-sized chunks. Just-barely good enough for people to get value out of it.

Maybe it will work maybe it won't. Only one way to find out.
