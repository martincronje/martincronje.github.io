title: Way to improve the structure of presentations
---

Over the years, many people have asked me for tips to improve their presentations.

intro...

My approach to speaking has been heavily influenced by Steve Jobs and some TED talks that I've seen over the years.

### Structure

Tell a story  
Stories have a beginning, middle and end  
Try to establish a common enemy if the content allows

### Delivery

Try to avoid memorising word for word what you want to say. In other words focus on remembering the key points that you want to talk about and the order of delivery. You are an expert and allow yourself the freedom to rely on that experience.

Be yourself, do not try to force yourself to emulate other speakers.

Be mindful that your biggest goal is to keep people's concentration while sharing your message.

Things that break people's concentration:

- Looking over your should to see the slides
- Moving or using your hands around without purpose
- Making apologies for mistakes
- Flicking through slides too quickly

People experience what you say.

- So if you say we have limited time they will experience the talk as being rushed.
- Where only some may have known about a mistake, alerting them makes everyone aware of it.
- Talking too much about problematic facilities makes people aware of that and could distract them.

### Slides

The goal is that people should be listening to you and not reading slides.

You should be able to delivery your presentation without the slides.

Avoid putting people in a position where they need to read or interpret slides.

If you must have bullets, limit each bullet to 6 words, have 6 bullets or less and introduce them one by one.

Whatever goes on slides should amplify what you are saying.

Time-permitting. Instead of using slide notes I like creating two versions of each slide. A hand-out and the presentation version. When done I upload the hand-out to speakerdeck

### Last but not least

It is good to be anxious or afraid. That energy helps you do awesome work. Take a break from speaking if that fear dwindles.
