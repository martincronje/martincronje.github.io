title: Agile sucks! Long live agility.
---

This post started out as a couple of thoughts on scrum after two conversations on Scrum today. One was was with [@rmaclean](https://twitter.com/rmaclean) when he said that he feels Scrum is broken.

Some notes on Scrum:  
It is a good starting point for people new to agile thinking  
If you retrospective are effective you will find that you transition away from Scrum after a while. Teams that run it by the book after many sprints are doing it wrong.  
In order for Scrum to be a good starting point it creates boundaries (training wheels) that actually end up holding the team back, such as fixed planning meetings, or the concept of sprints.  
There are some good things in Scrum, Lean and XP and you should cherry pick from all of them.
