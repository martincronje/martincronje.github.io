## Why?

You are probably reading this because we recently started working together. While I favour face-to-face communication to build relationships, &nbsp;I've found that this readme accelerates finding common ground.

The content of this evolving document is a reasonably up-to-date reflection on how to aspire to show up.

## Things I value

As an engineer at heart, I'm passionate about coaching and leading teams to build well-crafted software that delights customers. In my 25 years, I've come to value;

- _ **People above all:** _ The best software comes from people who have a sense of belonging and purpose and strive to lead balanced lifestyles.
- **_Feedback loops:_** Short, closed feedback loops, implemented in systems, processes and teams, are the life-blood of continuous improvement. Learn from our experiences and adapt to the environment.
- _ **Belonging and collaboration:** _ Our team is the culmination of each individual, so work hard on working together. Give everyone a voice because our diverse perspectives will help us build great software.
- _ **Growth and mentorship:** _ Software is about learning! So, invest in our personal development and the growth of others.
- **_Simplicity:_** Maximise value. Focus on one thing. Work in small steps.
- **_Excellence:_** Strive for pragmatism and effectiveness while nurturing our passion and creativity.

## My goal

Above all, I work for the team, and I aim to do this by;

- Providing alignment to vision, strategy, purpose, objectives and other teams,
- Supporting the team by creating an environment where they do their best work,
- Helping explore ideas, identify improvements and eliminate waste, and
- Mentoring, coaching and teaching the team as we grow together.

## Getting hold of me

It's vital that you have support when you need it most. Regardless of how busy my day is, I will drop whatever I can to be there for you.

- **_Slack_** for regular interaction.
- **_Text_** if it is urgent.
- I read _ **emails** _ irregularly.
- I'm usually in meetings and will only answer calls when people phone twice

I prefer talking face-to-face, and my calendar is usually pretty busy, **so ping me, and I will open up time for you.**

## Some things about me (and quirks)

- Don't be afraid to be painfully candid. I encourage you to open up and share.
- I welcome disagreement as a fantastic opportunity to grow and improve.
- I occasionally get animatedly excited, whether it is beautiful code, a novel process or small breakthroughs.
- My expression between being stressed, being tired, and deep thinking look the same. Don't be afraid to ask :-P
- I swear often. Let me know if it bugs you, and I will make an effort to manage it.
- When people ask questions, I occasionally pause for a seemingly long time to think about it.
- I think and reflect deeply and constantly.
- I work at odd hours. Please do not feel obliged to respond to me when you get messages from me.
